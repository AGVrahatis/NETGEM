	abstract = {A recent paper posed the question: Graph Matching:
                  What are we really talking about?. Far from
                  providing a definite answer to that question, in
                  this paper we will try to characterize the role that
                  graphs play within the Pattern Recognition field. To
                  this aim two taxonomies are presented and
                  discussed. The first includes almost all the graph
                  matching algorithms proposed from the late
                  seventies, and describes the different classes of
                  algorithms. The second taxonomy considers the types
                  of common applications of graph-based techniques in
                  the Pattern Recognition and Machine Vision field.},

	title = {Belief propagation and statistical physics},
	author = {Payam Pakzad},
	year = {2002},
	abstract = {Abstract — It was shown recently in [1] that there is a close connection between the belief propagation algorithm and certain approximations to the variational free energy in statistical physics. Specifically, the fixed points of the belief propagation algorithm are shown to coincide with the stationary points of the Bethe’s approximate free energy subject to consistency constraints. Bethe’s approximation is known as a special case of a general class of approximations called Kikuchi free energy approximations. A general class of belief propagation algorithms was also introduced in [1], which attempts to find the stationary points of a general Kikuchi free energy functional. In this paper we first examine the physical significance of the ‘free energy ’ functions, and review the general Kikuchi approximations using Möbius inversion formula. Next we define a general constrained minimization problem corresponding to the general Kikuchi approximation whose stationary points approximate marginals of a product function, and we specify a general class of local message passing algorithms along the edges of the Hasse diagram of the collection of Kikuchi regions, which attempt to solve that problem. We further give sufficient conditions under which a Kikuchi functional has a unique minimum, and/or closely approximates the exact free energy. These directly translate to conditions for the convergence and correctness of the belief propagation algorithm. I. Free Energy and Kikuchi Approximation Consider a system with N distinct and fixed sites. Attached to each site i is an elementary magnet which can take a spin value si from the set A of possible spins. Denote by s = (s1, · · · , sN) the configuration of the system. Then, under fundamental assumptions of thermal physics, it can be shown that if the system is in thermal equilibrium with a large reservoir, the probability that the system will be in a configuration s is given by the Boltzmann distribution: P (s) = e−εs/τ Z where εs is the energy of the system at state configuration s, and τ is the temperature(see [2]). Z is called the partition function of the system and is defined by The function},

	year = {2003},
	abstract = {In this paper we examine a general method of approximation, – known as Kikuchi approximation method, – for finding the marginals of a product-distribution. The Kikuchi approximation method defines a certain con-strained optimization problem, called the Kikuchi problem, and treats its stationary points as approximations to the desired marginals. In this paper we show how to associate a graph to any Kikuchi problem, and describe a class of local message-passing algorithms along the edges of any such graph, which attempt to find the solutions to the problem. We give conditions under which such algorithms converge to a stationary point of the optimization problem. Implementation of these algorithms on graphs with fewer edges require fewer operations in each iteration. We therefore characterize minimal graphs for a Kikuchi problem, which are those with the minimum number of edges, and show that all such minimal graphs have the same number of loops and share several important connectivity properties. We show that if the minimal graph is cycle-free, then Kikuchi approximation method is exact and the converse is also true generically; together with the fact that in the cycle-free case the above-mentioned iterative algorithms are equivalent to the well-known belief propagation algorithm, our results imply that, generically, Kikuchi approximation method can be exact if and only if traditional junction tree methods could also solve the problem exactly.},

@article{Weiss01GuassianBP,
	abstract = {Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, represent statistical dependencies of variables by a graph. Local "belief propagation" rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphs. Recently, good performance has been obtained by using these same rules on graphs with loops, a method we refer to as loopy belief propagation. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of "Turbo codes," whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theoretical understanding of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges, it gives the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks with a single loop. These results motivate using the powerful belief propagation algorithm in a broader class of networks and help clarify the empirical performance results.},
