\section{Motivation}
Microarrays have become a routine tool in biological enquiry, geared
to measure global gene expression in response to genetic or
environmental perturbations. The outcome is a vast amount of data, for
which many statistical methods have been developed. These methods
identify condition-dependent transcriptional regulation, but are not
suited to analyze time-series data. Furthermore, these methods ignore
the effect of the underlying interaction network of genes or
proteins. Substantial amount of additional information on the
interaction dynamics could be obtained if time were to be treated
appropriately in the context of the interaction network. 

\section{Results}
We present NET GEM, an algorithm that models temporal gene expression
data using Hidden Markov Models, within the constraints of an
underlying network. We used NET GEM to identify the dynamics of
interactions in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae or its isogenic
mutant during continuously changing nutritional environment. NET GEM
identified significant changes in the interactions between

\section{Availability:}
The source code for NET GEMM is available from http://www.website
\textcolor{red}{[will fill in before submission. The website mentions
  having a permanent website. I propose http://129.16.106.142/ where
  we collect all the tools. We should include a readme.txt that should
  have info on input files needed, their formatting, choosing
  parameters, output file description and their interpretation]}
