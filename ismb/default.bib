But the need behind a web search is often not informational -- it might be navigational (give me the url of the site I want to reach) or transactional (show me sites where I can perform a certain transaction, e.g. shop, download a file, or find a map). We explore this taxonomy of web searches and discuss how global search engines evolved to deal with web-specific needs.},

    abstract = {The identification of the user's intention or interest through queries that they submit to a search engine can be very useful to offer them more adequate results. In this work we present a framework for the identification of user's interest in an automatic way, based on the analysis of query logs. This identification is made from two perspectives, the objectives or goals of a user and the categories in which these aims are situated. A manual classification of the queries was made in order to have a reference point and then we applied supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The results obtained show that for a considerable amount of cases supervised learning is a good option, however through unsupervised learning we found relationships between users and behaviors that are not easy to detect just taking the query words. Also, through unsupervised learning we established that there are categories that we are not able to determine in contrast with other classes that were not considered but naturally appear after the clustering process. This allowed us to establish that the combination of supervised and unsupervised learning is a good alternative to find user's goals. From supervised learning we can identify the user interest given certain established goals and categories; on the other hand, with unsupervised learning we can validate the goals and categories used, refine them and select the most appropriate to the user's needs.},

                  What are we really talking about?. Far from
                  providing a definite answer to that question, in
                  this paper we will try to characterize the role that
                  graphs play within the Pattern Recognition field. To
                  this aim two taxonomies are presented and
                  discussed. The first includes almost all the graph
                  matching algorithms proposed from the late
                  seventies, and describes the different classes of
                  algorithms. The second taxonomy considers the types
                  of common applications of graph-based techniques in
                  the Pattern Recognition and Machine Vision field.},

	title = {Belief propagation and statistical physics},
	author = {Payam Pakzad},
	year = {2002},
	abstract = {Abstract — It was shown recently in [1] that there is a close connection between the belief propagation algorithm and certain approximations to the variational free energy in statistical physics. Specifically, the fixed points of the belief propagation algorithm are shown to coincide with the stationary points of the Bethe’s approximate free energy subject to consistency constraints. Bethe’s approximation is known as a special case of a general class of approximations called Kikuchi free energy approximations. A general class of belief propagation algorithms was also introduced in [1], which attempts to find the stationary points of a general Kikuchi free energy functional. In this paper we first examine the physical significance of the ‘free energy ’ functions, and review the general Kikuchi approximations using Möbius inversion formula. Next we define a general constrained minimization problem corresponding to the general Kikuchi approximation whose stationary points approximate marginals of a product function, and we specify a general class of local message passing algorithms along the edges of the Hasse diagram of the collection of Kikuchi regions, which attempt to solve that problem. We further give sufficient conditions under which a Kikuchi functional has a unique minimum, and/or closely approximates the exact free energy. These directly translate to conditions for the convergence and correctness of the belief propagation algorithm. I. Free Energy and Kikuchi Approximation Consider a system with N distinct and fixed sites. Attached to each site i is an elementary magnet which can take a spin value si from the set A of possible spins. Denote by s = (s1, · · · , sN) the configuration of the system. Then, under fundamental assumptions of thermal physics, it can be shown that if the system is in thermal equilibrium with a large reservoir, the probability that the system will be in a configuration s is given by the Boltzmann distribution: P (s) = e−εs/τ Z where εs is the energy of the system at state configuration s, and τ is the temperature(see [2]). Z is called the partition function of the system and is defined by The function},

	year = {2003},
	abstract = {In this paper we examine a general method of approximation, – known as Kikuchi approximation method, – for finding the marginals of a product-distribution. The Kikuchi approximation method defines a certain con-strained optimization problem, called the Kikuchi problem, and treats its stationary points as approximations to the desired marginals. In this paper we show how to associate a graph to any Kikuchi problem, and describe a class of local message-passing algorithms along the edges of any such graph, which attempt to find the solutions to the problem. We give conditions under which such algorithms converge to a stationary point of the optimization problem. Implementation of these algorithms on graphs with fewer edges require fewer operations in each iteration. We therefore characterize minimal graphs for a Kikuchi problem, which are those with the minimum number of edges, and show that all such minimal graphs have the same number of loops and share several important connectivity properties. We show that if the minimal graph is cycle-free, then Kikuchi approximation method is exact and the converse is also true generically; together with the fact that in the cycle-free case the above-mentioned iterative algorithms are equivalent to the well-known belief propagation algorithm, our results imply that, generically, Kikuchi approximation method can be exact if and only if traditional junction tree methods could also solve the problem exactly.},

@article{Weiss01GuassianBP,
	abstract = {Graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, represent statistical dependencies of variables by a graph. Local "belief propagation" rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities in singly connected graphs. Recently, good performance has been obtained by using these same rules on graphs with loops, a method we refer to as loopy belief propagation. Perhaps the most dramatic instance is the near Shannon-limit performance of "Turbo codes," whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy propagation. Except for the case of graphs with a single loop, there has been little theoretical understanding of loopy propagation. Here we analyze belief propagation in networks with arbitrary topologies when the nodes in the graph describe jointly gaussian random variables. We give an analytical formula relating the true posterior probabilities with those calculated using loopy propagation. We give sufficient conditions for convergence and show that when belief propagation converges, it gives the correct posterior means for all graph topologies, not just networks with a single loop. These results motivate using the powerful belief propagation algorithm in a broader class of networks and help clarify the empirical performance results.},

This database is a repository of 12 346 regulatory associations between transcription factors and target genes, based on experimental evidence which was spread throughout 861 bibliographic references. It also includes 257 specific DNA-binding sites for more than a hundred characterized transcription factors. Further information about each yeast gene included in the database was obtained from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), Regulatory Sequences Analysis Tools and Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium. Computational tools are also provided to facilitate the exploitation of the gathered data when solving a number of biological questions as exemplified in the Tutorial also available on the system. YEASTRACT allows the identification of documented or potential transcription regulators of a given gene and of documented or potential regulons for each transcription factor. It also renders possible the comparison between DNA motifs, such as those found to be over-represented in the promoter regions of co-regulated genes, and the transcription factor-binding sites described in the literature. The system also provides an useful mechanism for grouping a list of genes (for instance a set of genes with similar expression profiles as revealed by microarray analysis) based on their regulatory associations with known transcription factors.},

@article{citeulike:5209494,
    abstract = {Motivation: Cellular processes cause changes over time. Observing and measuring those changes over time allows insights into the how and why of regulation. The experimental platform for doing the appropriate large-scale experiments to obtain time-courses of expression levels is provided by microarray technology. However, the proper way of analyzing the resulting time course data is still very much an issue under investigation. The inherent time dependencies in the data suggest that clustering techniques which reflect those dependencies yield improved performance.  Results: We propose to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to account for the horizontal dependencies along the time axis in time course data and to cope with the prevalent errors and missing values. The HMMs are used within a model-based clustering framework.  We are given a number of clusters, each represented by one Hidden Markov Model from a finite collection encompassing typical qualitative behavior. Then, our method finds in an iterative procedure cluster models and an assignment of data points to these models that maximizes the joint likelihood of clustering and models.  Partially supervised learning--adding groups of labeled data to the initial collection of clusters--is supported. A graphical user interface allows quering an expression profile dataset for time course similar to a prototype graphically defined as a sequence of levels and durations. We also propose a heuristic approach to automate determination of the number of clusters.  We evaluate the method on published yeast cell cycle and fibroblasts serum response datasets, and compare them, with favorable results, to the autoregressive curves method.

@article{Yoneya2007,
    abstract = {MOTIVATION: Time series experiments of cDNA microarray have been commonly used in various biological studies and conducted under a lot of experimental factors. A popular approach of time series microarray analysis is to compare one gene with another in their expression profiles, and clustering expression sequences is a typical example. On the other hand, a practically important issue in gene expression is to identify a general timing difference which is caused by experimental factors. This type of difference can be extracted by comparing a set of time series expression profiles under a factor with that under another factor, and so it would be difficult to tackle this issue by using only a current approach for time series microarray analysis. RESULTS: We have developed a systematic method to capture the timing difference in gene expression under different experimental factors, based on hidden Markov models. Our model outputs a real-valued vector at each state and has an unique state transition diagram. The parameters of our model are trained from a given set of pairwise (generally multiplewise) expression sequences. We evaluated our model using synthetic as well as real microarray datasets. The results of our experiment indicate that our method worked favourably to identify a timing ordering under different experimental factors, such as that gene expression under Heat shock tended to start earlier than that under Oxidative stress.},

@article{Angelini2008BATS,
    abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene expression levels in a given cell can be influenced by different factors, namely pharmacological or medical treatments. The response to a given stimulus is usually different for different genes and may depend on time. One of the goals of modern molecular biology is the high-throughput identification of genes associated with a particular treatment or a biological process of interest. From methodological and computational point of view, analyzing high-dimensional time course microarray data requires very specific set of tools which are usually not included in standard software packages. Recently, the authors of this paper developed a fully Bayesian approach which allows one to identify differentially expressed genes in a 'one-sample' time-course microarray experiment, to rank them and to estimate their expression profiles. The method is based on explicit expressions for calculations and, hence, very computationally efficient. RESULTS: The software package BATS (Bayesian Analysis of Time Series) presented here implements the methodology described above. It allows an user to automatically identify and rank differentially expressed genes and to estimate their expression profiles when at least 5-6 time points are available. The package has a user-friendly interface. BATS successfully manages various technical difficulties which arise in time-course microarray experiments, such as a small number of observations, non-uniform sampling intervals and replicated or missing data. CONCLUSION: BATS is a free user-friendly software for the analysis of both simulated and real microarray time course experiments. The software, the user manual and a brief illustrative example are freely available online at the BATS website: http://www.na.iac.cnr.it/bats.},

    abstract = {A truly functional Bayesian method for detecting temporally differentially expressed genes between two experimental conditions is presented. The method distinguishes between two biologically different set ups, one in which the two samples are interchangeable, and one in which the second sample is a modification of the first, i.e. the two samples are non-interchangeable. This distinction leads to two different Bayesian models, which allow more flexibility in modeling gene expression profiles. The method allows one to identify differentially expressed genes, to rank them and to estimate their expression profiles. The proposed procedure successfully deals with various technical difficulties which arise in microarray time-course experiments, such as small number of observations, non-uniform sampling intervals and presence of missing data or repeated measurements. The procedure allows one to account for various types of error, thus offering a good compromise between nonparametric and normality assumption based techniques. In addition, all evaluations are carried out using analytic expressions, hence the entire procedure requires very little computational effort. The performance of the procedure is studied using simulated and real data.},

@article{Nam2009,
    abstract = {BACKGROUND:One of the most challenging problems in mining gene expression data is to identify how the expression of any particular gene affects the expression of other genes. To elucidate the relationships between genes, an association rule mining (ARM) method has been applied to microarray gene expression data. However, a conventional ARM method has a limit on extracting temporal dependencies between gene expressions, though the temporal information is indispensable to discover underlying regulation mechanisms in biological pathways. In this paper, we propose a novel method, referred to as temporal association rule mining (TARM), which can extract temporal dependencies among related genes. A temporal association rule has the form [gene A[arrow up], gene B[arrow down]] -> (7 min) [gene C[arrow up]], which represents that high expression level of gene A and significant repression of gene B followed by significant expression of gene C after 7 minutes. The proposed TARM method is tested with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle time-series microarray gene expression data set.RESULTS:In the parameter fitting phase of TARM, the fitted parameter set [threshold = +/- 0.8, support [greater than or equal to] 3 transactions, confidence [greater than or equal to] 90\%] with the best precision score for KEGG cell cycle pathway has been chosen for rule mining phase. With the fitted parameter set, numbers of temporal association rules with five transcriptional time delays (0, 7, 14, 21, 28 minutes) are extracted from gene expression data of 799 genes, which are pre-identified cell cycle relevant genes. From the extracted temporal association rules, associated genes, which play same role of biological processes within short transcriptional time delay and some temporal dependencies between genes with specific biological processes are identified.CONCLUSION:In this work, we proposed TARM, which is an applied form of conventional ARM. TARM showed higher precision score than Dynamic Bayesian network and Bayesian network. Advantages of TARM are that it tells us the size of transcriptional time delay between associated genes, activation and inhibition relationship between genes, and sets of co-regulators.},

In this book the authors present classical and recent results of matrix analysis that have proved to be important to applied mathematics. Facts about matrices, beyond those found in an elementary linear algebra course, are needed to understand virtually any area of mathematical science, but the necessary material has appeared only sporadically in the literature and in university curricula. As interest in applied mathematics has grown, the need for a text and reference offering a broad selection of topics in matrix theory has become apparent, and this book meets that need.    This volume reflects two concurrent views of matrix analysis. First, it encompasses topics in linear algebra that have arisen out of the needs of mathematical analysis. Second, it is an approach to real and complex linear algebraic problems that does not hesitate to use notions from analysis. Both views are reflected in its choice and treatment of topics.}},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the value is associated with each tested feature. The  value is similar to the well known  value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

    abstract = {Technologies to measure whole-genome mRNA abundances and methods to organize and display such data are emerging as valuable tools for systems-level exploration of transcriptional regulatory networks. For instance, it has been shown that mRNA data from 118 genes, measured at several time points in the developing hindbrain of mice, can be hierarchically clustered into various patterns (or 'waves') whose members tend to participate in common processes. We have previously shown that hierarchical clustering can group together genes whose cis-regulatory elements are bound by the same proteins in vivo. Hierarchical clustering has also been used to organize genes into hierarchical dendograms on the basis of their expression across multiple growth conditions. The application of Fourier analysis to synchronized yeast mRNA expression data has identified cell-cycle periodic genes, many of which have expected cis-regulatory elements. Here we apply a systematic set of statistical algorithms, based on whole-genome mRNA data, partitional clustering and motif discovery, to identify transcriptional regulatory sub-networks in yeast-without any a priori knowledge of their structure or any assumptions about their dynamics. This approach uncovered new regulons (sets of co-regulated genes) and their putative cis-regulatory elements. We used statistical characterization of known regulons and motifs to derive criteria by which we infer the biological significance of newly discovered regulons and motifs. Our approach holds promise for the rapid elucidation of genetic network architecture in sequenced organisms in which little biology is known.},

@article{Ernst06STEM,
    abstract = {BACKGROUND:Time series microarray experiments are widely used to study dynamical biological processes. Due to the cost of microarray experiments, and also in some cases the limited availability of biological material, about 80\% of microarray time series experiments are short (3-8 time points). Previously short time series gene expression data has been mainly analyzed using more general gene expression analysis tools not designed for the unique challenges and opportunities inherent in short time series gene expression data.RESULTS:We introduce the Short Time-series Expression Miner (STEM) the first software program specifically designed for the analysis of short time series microarray gene expression data. STEM implements unique methods to cluster, compare, and visualize such data. STEM also supports efficient and statistically rigorous biological interpretations of short time series data through its integration with the Gene Ontology.CONCLUSION:The unique algorithms STEM implements to cluster and compare short time series gene expression data combined with its visualization capabilities and integration with the Gene Ontology should make STEM useful in the analysis of data from a significant portion of all microarray studies. STEM is available for download for free to academic and non-profit users at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\~{}jernst/stem.},

@article{Tusher01sam,
    abstract = {Microarrays can measure the expression of thousands of genes to identify changes in expression between different biological states. Methods are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays, SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated FDR of 12\%, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84\% by using conventional methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision repair genes were induced, suggesting that this repair pathway for UV-damaged DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in repairing DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.},

@article{Ramoni02cluster,
    abstract = {This article presents a Bayesian method for model-based clustering of gene expression dynamics. The method represents gene-expression dynamics as autoregressive equations and uses an agglomerative procedure to search for the most probable set of clusters given the available data. The main contributions of this approach are the ability to take into account the dynamic nature of gene expression time series during clustering and a principled way to identify the number of distinct clusters. As the number of possible clustering models grows exponentially with the number of observed time series, we have devised a distance-based heuristic search procedure able to render the search process feasible. In this way, the method retains the important visualization capability of traditional distance-based clustering and acquires an independent, principled measure to decide when two series are different enough to belong to different clusters. The reliance of this method on an explicit statistical representation of gene expression dynamics makes it possible to use standard statistical techniques to assess the goodness of fit of the resulting model and validate the underlying assumptions. A set of gene-expression time series, collected to study the response of human fibroblasts to serum, is used to identify the properties of the method.},
