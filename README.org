This is the supplemental software for the ISMB 2010 submission,
"Network Embedded analysis of Temporal Gene Expression using Mixed
Models". 

* Abstract 

Microarrays have become a routine tool in many biological labs,
resulting in large amounts of datasets containing transcription
information in different mutants grown under many conditions. The data
from a microarray experiment is a snapshot of the transcription at the
time of measurement. Therefore, the conventional methods (log-fold
changes, clustering algorithms, etc) have successfully identified
transcriptional regulation. Applying these methods to time-series gene
expression data inherently assumes that the data points are
independent and therefore, losing the temporal evolution of gene
expression. Furthermore, many of these methods do not consider the
underlying interaction network of genes or proteins they encode for,
that plays a key role in the expression of the genes.

This complete code along with the data is available at http://www.github.com/vjethava/NETGEMM. 
It can be downloaded in linux by using the command: \$ git clone git@github.com:vjethava/NETGEMM.git

* Files

The top-level directory structure is as follows: 

- code: contains the matlab functions specific to the paper.
- lib: publicly available code which is used.
- ismb: conference submission files. 
- lib: additional libraries.
- test: the files which run the main experiments. 
- data: the original data in txt and mat formats
- scripts: the conversion scripts between txt-mat 
** data
The raw data can be found in the following files: 

- aean_expr.txt: Gene expression data corresponding to experiment 1
  (Aerobic and Anaerobic setting)
- exp2: This directory has the complete processed data (in matlab
  format) for Experiment 2, i.e., graph_pp.mat (Graph), graph.mat
  (Graph if taking both P-P and P-D) interactions, gene_names.txt,
  expr.mat (gene expression data)

The original raw data provided by biologists is given as xls and xml
format. 
 

** test
This directory contains the following files:
- mm_svar.m : generates the comparison for multiple strains over synthetic dataset
- mm_tvar.m : generates the comparison for different number of
  observation time periods available for synthetic dataset
- run1.m : runs the experiment 1 for gene expression dataset 1 
- run2.m runs the experiment 2 for gene expression dataset 2

** results: 
This directory contains the plots for the synthetic dataset as well as
the generated movies for each of the experiments based on real
datasets.     

** ismb:
This directory contains the draft of the final submission.
